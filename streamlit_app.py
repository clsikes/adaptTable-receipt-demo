        SYSTEM PROMPT: Receipt Item Extraction & Formatting
        Task:
        Extract and format all items below from a grocery receipt processed through OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for inclusion in a master shopping record. This record will support later analysis of dietary habits, food preferences, and household size.
        Instructions:
        Data Review:
        • Review all extracted receipt content carefully.
        • Do not remove any items, including non-food or miscellaneous products.
        • Do not infer, hallucinate, or fabricate missing or unclear items.
        • Do not consolidate duplicates — list each item exactly as it appears and in the order it was found.
        Output Formatting:
        • Store Name: As printed on the receipt
        • Date: As printed on the receipt
        • Items:
        o Present as a numbered list, maintaining original order
        o For each item, preserve original wording.
        o Expand confidently known abbreviations or recognizable product names using → formatting, even if the original is abbreviated.
        o Always use → when expanding or correcting an item name.
        Abbreviation Expansion Rules:
        • Expand abbreviations or recognizable names only if you are highly confident of the full name (e.g., “GV Shpsh” → “Great Value Sharp Shredded Cheddar”), and always use → to show the expansion.
        • If you are not sure, leave the original abbreviation untouched and move the item to a clearly labeled “Ambiguous Items” section at the bottom, with a short note explaining why it wasn’t expanded.
        • If the exact item name is uncertain but the food category is confidently identifiable (e.g., fresh produce, dairy, snack foods), classify the item with a high-level category tag (e.g., “[Uncertain Product Name] – Fresh Produce”) instead of marking it ambiguous. Use this only when category assignment is useful for downstream dietary analysis and expansion would otherwise be speculative.
        OCR Correction Guidelines:
        • Correct only clear OCR typos (e.g., “Chedar” → “Cheddar”)
        • Do not interpret categories or food types — preserve the item’s literal content.
        • Prioritize data integrity over clarity. When unsure, keep the original.

        Example Output:
        
        Store Name: Walmart  
        Date: 03/21/2025  
        
        1. GV Shpsh → Great Value Sharp Shredded Cheddar  
        2. GV ZPR SANDW → Great Value Zipper Sandwich Bags  
        3. PAL ORI 828 → Palmolive Original 828ml  
        4. TIDEHEORG107 → Tide HE Original 107oz  
        5. CHRMNSF4 → Charmin Soft 4-pack  
        6. BNTYSAS2 4 → Bounty Paper Towels 2-ply 4-pack  
        7. NUTELLA 725G  
        8. 90G POUF → 90g Bath Pouf  
        
        Ambiguous Items:  
        1. CCSERVINGBWL – Unclear item code; not confidently identifiable

        Return only the structured output in this format. Do not add explanations, notes, or commentary.
