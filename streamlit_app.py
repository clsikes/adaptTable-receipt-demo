            - Use the ‚ÄúExpansion‚Äù column to rewrite the full product name if you can confidently infer it from:
              - Common abbreviations (e.g., ‚ÄúGV SHP SH‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúGreat Value Sharp Shredded Cheddar‚Äù)
              - Known store-brand items (e.g., Walmart‚Äôs Great Value)

              - Product codes or sizes when common (e.g., ‚Äú1.62Z KA LIQ‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äú1.62 oz Kool-Aid Liquid‚Äù)
            - If the item is unclear or unknown, mark the Expansion as `Ambiguous`
            
            Do not:
            - Skip items
            - Remove duplicates
            - Guess fictional products
            - Reorganize or reclassify
            - Add a third column or commentary
            
            If the receipt includes a store name, use it to inform what types of products are likely to appear.
            
            You may expand even without 100% certainty when:
            - The expansion is widely accepted/common at that store
            - The abbreviation closely matches a well-known grocery item
